# ubiquitous-bot
Software and hardware configurations for an autonomous, remote-controlled, line-following, and obstacle-avoidance robot.

All components and materials needed to build:

Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
Motor driver (e.g., L298N) for motor control
Ultrasonic sensors (HC-SR04) for obstacle detection
Servo motor for scanning and obstacle avoidance
Line tracking sensors (if building a line-following robot)
LEDs and a buzzer for indicating car status (if building an obstacle-avoidance robot)
Chassis, wheels, and power sources specific to your robot design
Jumper wires for connecting components
A breadboard (optional)
